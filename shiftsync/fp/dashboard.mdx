## Clocking Status

The **Clocking Status** tab provides a real-time summary of all users on the system. It shows how many staff members are clocked in, clocked out, on breaks, or missing. You can also view a detailed list of each team member, including their current status and the exact time their status last changed.

<Info>
  This tab does not display all users on the system. It only shows anyone who has joined your game session, even if they have since left. **Note that this data resets when the server closes or restarts.**

## Time Off Requests

You can view all pending and approved time off requests. See how they appear on your dashboard below:
