    ```

    - In your Roblox group, you will have roles which have their own ID. **Please add all of the role IDs** where those roles are specifically meant for staff
    - All IDs must be placed inside of the     , **followed by a comma for each of them**, as shown

    ```lua

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Settings">
    - Please create a random string of **letters and numbes for your data key**. This data key stores shifts, departments, time-off requests and clock-in data

    ```

    - Please repeat the same for the following other data keys:

    ["Shifts Data Key"] = "MyShiftSync-Shifts",
    ```

    <Warning>
      When you change these data keys, **it will reset all of your data**, so please keep that in mind
    </Warning>
    - You can enable `Vision Names`, which will fetch version `v.1.7` roleplay names. These names will be displayed on some areas of the system

    ```lua
    ["Vision Names"] = true,
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terminal Settings">
    - `Interaction` is the type of interaction that takes place for users
    - We have two options for interactions, `ProximityPrompt` (a popup asking you to hold E) or `ClickDetector` (click on the fingerprint sensor)

    ```lua
    ["Interaction"] = "ClickDetector",
    ```

    - You must also **set the maximum distance** required to interact with the terminal
    - The lower the number, the closer you must be to interact

    ```lua
    ["Maximum Distance"] = 5,
    ```

    - We offer one theme, which is the beloved **Blurple**. We intend to add many more in the future, which you will be able to change to those by editing the configuraton element
    - If you enter anything incorrect, it will just default to **Blurple**.

    ```lua
    ["UI Theme"] = "Blurple",
    ```

    - The zoom time is the amount of seconds it takes for your camera to zoom in/out of the terminal

    ```lua
    ["Zoom Time"] = 0.5,
    ```

    - You have the option to require terminal users to enter a PIN number when first accessing the system
    - To enable this, change `false` to `true`
    - To edit the PIN number, replace the `"1234"` with anything of your choosing, for example `"0491"`

    ```lua
    ["Requires PIN"] = {Enabled = false, PIN = "1234"},
    ```

    ![SS1 Pn](/images/SS1.png)

    - You can also enable `External Notifications` - which display messages to users if they are not currently interacting with the system
    - This feature is important for users who would like to be notified for certain events (e.g break ending, shift starting)

    ![SS2 Pn](/images/SS2.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System Settings">
    ## Breaks and Clocking Out

    - You are able to **toggle the ability for users to take breaks**
    - To disable breaks, change `true` to `false`

    ```lua
    ["Breaks Allowed"] = true,
    ```

    <Tip>
      You can also **disable or enable this in-game** using the system settings panel in Settings
    </Tip>
    - You can set the **minimum number of minutes** for a break to be classified as a break within the system
    - This is required to be at least `1` by default
    - For example, you could set this to 5, and it would require users to wait 5 minutes before the break can be ended

    ```lua
    ["Minimum Break Time"] = 1,
    ```

    - You can set the **maximum number of minutes** a break can be
    - Once a break has reached the maximum, it will automatically end, and will notify the user

    ```lua
    ["Maximum Break Time"] = 3,
    ```

    - You can set the **minimum minutes** required before clocking out

    ## Core Settings

    - You are able to **change the timezone** for the system based on any of the options below

    <Accordion title="List of Timezones">
      BST - British Summer Time

      GMT - Greenwich Mean Time

      EET - Eastern European Time

      CET - Central European Time

      ET - Eastern Time

      CT - Central Time

      AEST - Australian Eastern Standard Time

      AEDT - Australian Eastern Daylight Time
    </Accordion>
    ```lua
    ["Timezone"] = "BST",
    ```

    - You can **toggle the dashboard**, which removes the ability to view staff information, departments, shifts and reports
    - All users would only be able to access the main functions: clock in, clock out, start/end breaks
    - To disable this, change `true` to `false`

    ```lua
    ["Dashboard Enabled"] = true,
    ```

    - You can toggle **debug mode**, which allows us (developers) and support team to identify any issues you are facing
    - You may be advised to enable this if you find yourself in need of support
    - It is recommended to leave this disabled (as `false`) by default

    ```lua
    ["Debug Mode"] = false,
    ```

    - You can choose how often the **system data is periodically saved**
    - We recommend leaving this at 300 seconds (5 minutes)

    <Info>
      **Data will automatically save every 5 minutes**, and will save when the server shuts down
    </Info>
    ```lua
    ["Save Data"] = 300,
    ```

    - You can customise the **cooldown**, which prevents users from interacting with core functions (home page buttons), and notification popups
    - This is required to be at least `1` by default

    ```lua
    ["Cooldown"] = 3,
    ```

    ## Shifts

    - You can customise the **minimum shift length** (in minutes), which is how long a shift must be when creating it
    - This must be at least `1` minute by default
    - For example, `Minimum Shift Length` is `60`, which means a shift must be at **least 60 minutes**, otherwise <u>it cannot be created</u>

    ```lua
    ["Minimum Shift Length"] = 1,
    ```

    - You can customise the **maximum shift length** (in minutes), which is the maximum duration of a shift
    - This must be at least `1` minute by default
    - For example, `Maximum Shift Length` is `120`, which means a shift **cannot be more than** 120 minutes

    ```lua
    ["Maximum Shift Length"] = 540,
    ```

    <Info>
      **The default maximum shift length is 9 hours**
    </Info>
    ## Miscellaneous

    - You can **toggle the ability for users to be able to request time off**
    - To disable time off requests, change `true` to `false`

    ```lua
    ["Allow Timeoff Request"] = true,
    ```

    - You can set the **number of days in which a time off request start date must be within**
    - For example, set the `Approval Window Days` to `7`, means that any time off requests must start within 7 days

    ```lua
    ["Approval Window Days"] = 7,
    ```

    - You can set the **minimum number of days required for a time off** request
    - By default, this is required to be at least `1` day
    - For example, if you set minimum days off to `14`, it would mean users <u>must</u> have time off for at least 14 days

    ```lua
    ["Minimum Days Off"] = 1,
    ```

    - You can set the **maximum number of days available for a time off** request
    - The overall maximum is `365` days (`1 year` )
    - For example, if you set the maximum number of days to `60`, it will allow users to **have their end date reach 60 days ahead of the current date**, therefore _offering a maximum of 60 days off_

    ```lua
    ["Maximum Time Off Days"] = 30,
    ```

    - You can toggle **description required** for when **users create time off** requests
    - When disabled, users are **<u>not</u>** required to add a description for time off
    - To disable this, change `true` to `false`

    ```lua
    ["Description Required"] = true,
    ```

    - You can customise the reasons for requesting time off
    - The maximum number of reasons off is `5`

    **<u>The following options are provided by default:</u>**

    ```lua
    ["Timeoff Types"] = {  
    	"Personal Leave",
    	"Training Leave",
    	"Holiday Leave",
    	"Relocation Leave",
    	"Other Leave",
    }
    ```

    To edit one of the above, just replace the contents within the `" "` \
    For example, if I want to change `"Other Leave"` to `"General Leave"` 

    ```lua
    ["Timeoff Types"] = {  
    	"Personal Leave",
    	"Training Leave",
    	"Holiday Leave",
    	"Relocation Leave",
    	"General Leave", -- I have edited this one
    }
    ```
