  <Accordion title="Isolations">
    Isolations allow you to **restrict a player to a specific room** within the school for an act of behaviour which could prevent them from being in lessons. We have developed an isolation system through Vision, allowing staff to log an isolation, which forces the student to be teleported into an isolation room.

    ![Image(63) Pn](/images/image\(63\).png)

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Logging an isolation">
        Allows staff to input information such as time of incident, student, severity and isolation reason. Similar to the incident logging, however this can be used for much more severe acts of malicious behaviour.

        <Check>
          You can now select a **preset location** for where the student should be teleported to
        </Check>

        ![Image(65) Pn](/images/image\(65\).png)

      <Step title="Isolation logged">
        Upon logging an isolation, **you can manage the isolation** by clicking on it when it appears in the dashboard

        You are able to respawn the user or delete the isolation from records.
