### Week Timetable

<Tip>
  The timetable management allows for setting lesson details for each day of the week . **Administrators are able to save and configure lessons throughout the week, for each year group.**
</Tip>

- By default, **the timetable will load the current day** and the timetable that has been set
- Administrators can view the dropdown in the top left, and **can select a day of the week**
- **As you toggle through the days, the information will change** depending on the already existing lessons for that day

**As shown below**, the edit lesson popup appears, allowing you to enter lesson information for that specific lesson, for that year group, and that day of the week. After finishing, you can press Save Lesson to save that information.
