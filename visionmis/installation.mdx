  <Accordion title="Webhook integration" icon="webhook">
    A webhook is a **discord integration** that allows you to send authorised messages to a discord channel from an external application, in this case, **Vision MIS.**

    <Tip>
      Learn more about [discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks), and how to set them up
    </Tip>
    ```python
    ["VisionWebhookURL"] = "",
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="In-game commands" icon="message">
    In-game commands are a recently added feature, allowing you to quickly perform actions without directly interacting with the Vision MIS dashboard.

    ```javascript
    ["Commands"] = {
    	-- Chat-based Vision control commands
    	Enabled = true, -- Enable/disable commands
    	Prefix = "%", -- Command prefix
    	
    	["CommandNames"] = {
    		Isolate = "isolate", 
    		Positive = "merit", 
    		Negative = "demerit", 
    		Relocate = "relocate", 
    		NonUniform = "nonuniform", 
    		Timeout = "timeout", 
    	}
    },
    ```

    The code snippet above contains **key attributes** that determine the functionality of the  commands

    - To **disable commands**, replace `Enabled = true` with `Enabled = false`
    - To **change the prefix** for commands, replace `Prefix = "%"` with your own prefix, for example `Prefix = ":"`
    - To change a command name, look for the command you want to change under `["CommandNames"]` and replace the command name in the " " with your new command name.
      - For example, replace `Positive = "merit"` with `Positive = "positive"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="On call alerts" icon="diamond-exclamation">
    On call alerts allow specific users with specific roles to receive alerts when a request is made from a member of staff. The configuration for this is very simple

    ```javascript
    ["OnCallsEnabled"] = true,
    ["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}, -- Choose every rank ID, separated by a comma which are able to manage on call alerts
    ```

    Within `["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}`, **you can add or remove role IDs**. These IDs are gathered from your Roblox group.

    To add a new role to the list, just add the number of the role ID in the `{}` . For example, if I added 255, it would now look like `{1, 2, 3, 255}`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nametags" icon="tags">
    A series of <u>attributes</u> for nametags can be toggled to adjust to your needs

    ```javascript
    ["NametagsEnabled"] = true, -- Toggle nametags being visible
    ["Staff Icon"] = true, -- Toggles staff icon above staff nametag
    ["Admin Icon"] = true, -- Toggles admin icon above admin nametag
    ```

    - **To disable one of the above**, just change `true` to `false`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gamepasses and lanyards" icon="passport">
    You are **_no longer required to use gamepass IDs_** to give out non-uniform or timeout passes. To disable the gamepass feature, just set the `GamepassID` to `0` . Otherwise, replace 0 with your gamepass ID if you wish to use this feature.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Non Uniform">
        ```javascript
        ["NonUniformPass"] = { 
        	Enabled = false,

      <Tab title="Lanyards">
        ```python
        ["Lanyards"] = {
        	Enabled = true, 
        	ColorTheme = Color3.fromRGB(255, 146, 32),
        	LogoID = 0

        	LogoID = 0 
        },
        ```

        When lanyards are set to `Enabled = true`, staff will receive lanyards automatically. Please set this to `false` if you wish or staff **not** to have built in Vision lanyards.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Lanyards">
        ```python
        ["CustomLanyards"] = {

        			TextureType = "Student" 
        		},
        	},
        },

            You have successfully added your own custom lanyard. Ensure to set `Enabled = true` for it to take effect

            - `TextureType` is a configurable setting so the lanyard shows various different textures depending on the group type for example.
            - Set the TextureType to one of the following: **Senior Leader, Student, Staff or Custom.** For example `TextureType = "Senior Leader"`, or `TextureType = "Custom"`
            - You must set your group name correctly. Replace `["Group Name"]` with the name of the **year group** that you want to issue this lanyard to. You can find <u>group settings</u> later on in the configuration.
            - For example, if my **Group Name** was **Year 7**, I would set it to `["Year 7"]`
            - Add each of the **Roblox group role IDs** into the `RoleIds = {}` separated by a comma. Each of these roles will be given the lanyard

## Setting Up

Once you have retrieved the necessary information for system setup,

**Run the** `/setup` **command to initiate the setup process**. You will be prompted an embed with a button on it, click the button and a modal form will popup asking you to input the information you retrieved before.

Input the information into all the fields and then click **Submit.** If the setup was successful you will be notified, else you will receive an error message stating what went wrong.

<Info>
  If you do not want any system logs enter a **0 (zero)** when asked for a Channel Id.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If you update your in-game datastore names within your Vision settings, the cached datastore names in our database will become out of sync with the live stores. View the **System Refresh** section to refresh the cached names.
</Warning>

### System Permissions

Ensure that you setup the correct permissions before attempting to run any commands. By default, some commands are locked to "Staff" ranks and some to "Admin" ranks, much like the in-game Vision system. Currently, you are **unable** to specify which commands you want to lock to administrator or staff members.

**Our current command permissions are below:**

| **Staff & Admin Commands** | **Admin Commands**                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| analytics                  | attendance                                      |
| year-analytics             | timeout-pass **grant**  timeout-pass **remove** |
| timetable                  | uniform-pass **grant**  uniform-pass **remove** |
| search                     |                                                 |
| roleplay-name              |                                                 |
| timeout-pass **has**       |                                                 |
| uniform-pass **has**       |                                                 |
| merit                      |                                                 |
| behaviour-point            |                                                 |
| incident                   |                                                 |
| isolate                    |                                                 |
| detention                  |                                                 |

<Info>
  Guild Members who have any administrative roles can access both admin and staff locked commands. Guild Members who have any staff roles can only access staff locked commands.
</Info>

### Adding Roles

To add permission roles to the system, use the `/permissions add`  command followed by a **Discord Role Id** and the permission type. Any member with the role that has been added will receive the permission type selected.

![Image(11) Pn](/images/image\(11\).png)

### Removing Roles

Removing a permitted role in the system is as easy as running the `/permissions remove`  command followed by the **Discord Role Id** and the existing permission type. Anybody with the role and no other permitted roles will now be unable to run any permission locked commands.

![Image(12) Pn](/images/image\(12\).png)

### Viewing Permitted Roles

If you need to check which roles have been configured to have certain permissions, use the `/permissions list`  command. When you have ran the command you will be able to view all Admin roles and all Staff roles. If a role was to have been deleted, you will be able to view the id to remove the role.

![Image(13) Pn](/images/image\(13\).png)

### System Reset

If you need to quickly reset every setting, use the `/reset` command to remove **all** settings relating to the Vision bot inside of your guild. You will be asked before you continue to reset the system.

<Check>
  The reset command **does not** reset any in-game Vision data such as student merits and behaviour points
</Check>

### System Refresh

If you update your in-game datastores within your settings, the cached datastore names will become out of sync and will no longer display up-to-date information from when you run the command.

To fix this, run the `/refresh-databases`  command. Upon running it, you will be prompted before refreshing the database names and once the command has been ran, it will become unavailable for **2 minutes.**

_We cache datastore names so we do not have to request the current datastore names every time a command has been ran._

### System Updates

If you need to update any settings which you provided when you setup the system, you can use the `/update`  command to edit any of the initial settings.

You will be asked which setting you want to update, the settings include:

| **Information** | **Description**                                                             |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Experience Id   | The experience id of your game which contains the Vision System.            |
| OpenCloud Key   | An API key to interact with the in-game Vision System from Discord.         |
| Community Id    | The id of your Roblox group/community.                                      |
| Log Channel Id  | The id of a log channel within your Discord server to send all bot logs to. |

### Command Cooldowns

By default, we enforce cooldowns on some of our commands to prevent spam and abuse, we may also add cooldowns to any commands that may use a lot of resources to run. The current commands on our cooldowns are found below:

| **Command**       | **Duration** <Icon icon="clock" /> |
| ----------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| behaviour-point   | 30 seconds                         |
| merit             | 30 seconds                         |
| detention         | 30 seconds                         |
| incident          | 30 seconds                         |
| isolate           | 30 seconds                         |
| timetable         | 30 seconds                         |
| refresh-databases | 2 minutes                          |

## Behavioural Commands

This page outlines the information needed for using the behavioural commands. It is important that you read the information provided on this page carefully before contacting support that your system doesn't work.

When **any** behavioural command is ran (includes merit, isolation, detention etc) the command will take affect in-game **instantly** as long as the server is currently running and the student is in-game when the command has been ran.

All behavioural commands will log to the specified log channel, if it has been provided, in the same format as the normal in-game Vision format.

<Note>
  Please note, if the Roblox server is not running or the student is not in-game the year group and lifetime analytics will **not be updated.**
</Note>

### Isolations

The `/isolation` on command will automatically team, respawn and teleport the student if they are in-game. A notice will also appear on the student's screen alerting them of the isolation, and the behavioural dashboard will update to reflect the newly added isolation.

**The command offers 5 options for usability, they are listed below:**

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Student Username | The username of the student beign isolated.                         |
| Reason           | A reason for the isolation, pick from the listed few.               |
| Summary          | A summary of the incident.                                          |
| Destination      | The location to send the student — **view more information below.** |
| Comments         | Any extra information relating to the situation.                    |

<Warning>
  When isolating a student, the destination you provide **must match an in-game location**. If the location does not match, the student will not be brought to the Isolation room correctly. You can either retrieve it via the named spawns in the workspace system or view the current set ones from the in-game UI.

  ![Image Avi](/images/image.avif)
</Warning>

### Incidents

The `/incident`  command will add to the incident dashboard as normal with the ability to resolve them and view other students involved.

**The command asks for 3 required fields and 2 non-required.**

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Summary          | A full summary of the incident that occurred.                                       |
| Others           | Any other students involved — Roblox usernames **separated by commas**              |

### Detentions

When the `/detention`command is ran, the specified student will be alerted in-game when they receive a detention, as well as the behavioural dashboard updating accordingly. The current command options are:

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Student Username | The username of the student receiving the detention.                                                                       |

| Type             | The detention type, pick from the listed few.  _Option picked has no command affect, purely visual based._                 |
| Location         | The location of where the detention will be, e.g. Ma2 or Sc3.  _Option picked has no command affect, purely visual based._ |
| Comments         | Any other pieces of information the staff member wishes to provide regarding the situation.                                |

### Merits & Behaviour Points

The `/merit`and `/behaviour-point`commands act very similarly, they both take the same command options and act the same way in-game apart from the on-screen UI being different.

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Amount           | The amount of merits/behaviour points to give.                                             |
| Location         | The location of where the merit/behaviour point was given.                                 |
| Comments         | Any other pieces of information the staff member wishes to provide regarding the situation |

## Student Management

**When any student management command is ran the command will take affect in-game instantly**, as long as the server is currently running and the student is in-game when the command has been ran.

All student management commands will log to the specified log channel, if it has been provided, in the same format as the normal in-game Vision format.

<Note>
  Please note, if the Roblox server is not running or the student is not in-game the year group and lifetime analytics will not be updated.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If your game has timeout or uniform passes enabled via game passes —  if a student joins the game and owns either pass after having their pass removed manually they will **automatically receive the pass again**. This is because we can't remove the functionality of a paid gamepass.

  If you **do not** want this to happen, disable gamepass purchasing to keep it admin applied only.
</Warning>

### Roleplay Name

The `/roleplay-name`  command allows students to change their own roleplay name, as well as staff members being able to change student usernames. You must provide the new name along with the student name _if changing someone else's name._

<Check>
  All names are filtered by our service. However, we cannot guarantee that users won't bypass the system; therefore, we accept no responsibility for any inappropriate names being sent to Roblox servers.
</Check>

### Timeout Pass

The `/timeout-pass`  subcommands let staff members check if a student has a timeout pass and allows admins to grant or remove passes. **This change will take affect instantly** giving the student the timeout pass icon and removing it when it has been revoked.

### Uniform Pass

The `/uniform-pass`  subcommands let staff members check if a student has a uniform pass and allows admins to grant or remove passes. **This change will take affect instantly** giving the student the uniform pass icon and removing it when it has been revoked.

### User Searching

Using the `/search`  command allows staff members to search for a student to view their information. The command also allows you to view other staff members; however, it displays different details. Each search displays the user's avatar with a random coloured background.

<Warning>
  Any staff member who has not joined the game since implementing the Vision 1.7 update into your game will be \*\*incorrectly \*\*marked as a student member. This issue is unavoidable and we are aware of it.
</Warning>

### Analytics

To view statistics across all year groups, you can use the `/analytics`  command to retrieve information from a specific time period. A specific date can be selected, or you can view <u>lifetime</u> data.

### Year Analytics

Statistics from a specific year group can easily be viewed using the `/year-analytics`  command followed by the year group you want to view. All data returned is lifetime, not specific dates.

Year groups will automatically be filled in and are cached for 2 minutes to prevent spam of requests to Roblox API's. If you change your year groups in-game, they will eventually update in Discord after the caching period has ended.

<Info>
  You can manually type out a full year groups name rather than waiting for options to load.
