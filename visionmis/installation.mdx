    You are required to have unique **data store keys**, which are a series of random words or numbers that are used to identify and store data within your game.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook integration" icon="webhook">
    A webhook is a **discord integration** that allows you to send authorised messages to a discord channel from an external application, in this case, **Vision MIS.**

    <Tip>
      Learn more about [discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks), and how to set them up
    </Tip>
    ```python
    ["VisionWebhookURL"] = "",
    ["WebhookColors"] = { -- Must be a hex value, with '0x' positioned before
    	["Green"] = tonumber(0x2c8c26),
    	["Red"] = tonumber(0xba2b20),
    	["Orange"] = tonumber(0xff9220),
    	["Grey"] = tonumber(0x595959)
    },
    ```

    For your webhook colours, the ones provided are default, and you **<u>do not need to change these</u>**. Feel free to use this [colour picker](https://g.co/kgs/d9iGsLL) if you wish to change these colours.

    <Check>
      When you find a colour you want to use, copy the **HEX** code provided. For example, I will use `#0d0d0d` . In the configuration above, you would place any digits <u>after</u> the 0x, so instead of `tonumber(0x2c8c26),`  it now looks like `tonumber(#0x0d0d0d),`
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="In-game commands" icon="message">
    In-game commands are a recently added feature, allowing you to quickly perform actions without directly interacting with the Vision MIS dashboard.

    ```python
    ["Commands"] = {
    	-- Chat-based Vision control commands
    	Enabled = true, -- Enable/disable commands
    	Prefix = "%", -- Command prefix
    	
    	["CommandNames"] = {
    		Isolate = "isolate", -- e.g %isolate USER REASON or %isolate USER
    		Positive = "merit", -- e.g %merit USER AMOUNT or %merit USER
    		Negative = "demerit", -- e.g %demerit USER AMOUNT or %demerit USER
    		Relocate = "relocate", -- e.g %relocate USER REASON or %relocate USER
    		NonUniform = "nonuniform", -- e.g %nonuniform USER
    		Timeout = "timeout", -- e.g %timeout USER
    	}
    },
    ```

    The code snippet above contains **key attributes** that determine the functionality of the  commands

    - To **disable commands**, replace `Enabled = true` with `Enabled = false`
    - To **change the prefix** for commands, replace `Prefix = "%"` with your own prefix, for example `Prefix = ":"`
    - To change a command name, look for the command you want to change under `["CommandNames"]` and replace the command name in the " " with your new command name.
      - For example, replace `Positive = "merit"` with `Positive = "positive"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="On call alerts" icon="diamond-exclamation">
    On call alerts allow specific users with specific roles to receive alerts when a request is made from a member of staff. The configuration for this is very simple

    ```python
    ["OnCallsEnabled"] = true,
    ["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}, -- Choose every rank ID, separated by a comma which are able to manage on call alerts
    ```

    Within `["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}`, **you can add or remove role IDs**. These IDs are gathered from your Roblox group.

    To add a new role to the list, just add the number of the role ID in the `{}` . For example, if I added 255, it would now look like `{1, 2, 3, 255}`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nametags" icon="tags">
    A series of <u>attributes</u> for nametags can be toggled to adjust to your needs

    ```python
    ["NametagsEnabled"] = true, -- Toggle nametags being visible
    ["Staff Icon"] = true, -- Toggles staff icon above staff nametag
    ["Admin Icon"] = true, -- Toggles admin icon above admin nametag
    ```

    - **To disable one of the above**, just change `true` to `false`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gamepasses and lanyards" icon="passport">
    You are **_no longer required to use gamepass IDs_** to give out non-uniform or timeout passes. To disable the gamepass feature, just set the `GamepassID` to `0` . Otherwise, replace 0 with your gamepass ID if you wish to use this feature.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Non Uniform">
        ```python
        ["NonUniformPass"] = { 
        	Enabled = false, 
        	GamepassID = 0, 
        },
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Timeout">
        ```python
        ["TimeoutPass"] = { 
        	Enabled = false, 
        	GamepassID = 0, 
        },
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Lanyards">
        ```python
        ["Lanyards"] = {
        	Enabled = true, 
        	ColorTheme = Color3.fromRGB(255, 146, 32),
        	LogoID = 0
        },
        ```

        When lanyards are set to `Enabled = true`, staff will receive lanyards automatically. Please set this to false if you wish for staff \*\*not \*\*to have built in Vision lanyards.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Lanyards">
        ```python
        ["CustomLanyards"] = {
        	Enabled = false,
        		
        	GroupLanyards = {
        		["Sixth Form"] = {
        			Enabled = false,
        			CardColourTheme = Color3.fromRGB(34, 67, 35),
        			LanyardTitleColour = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255),
        			TextureType = "Student" 
        		},
        	},
        },
        ```

        Custom Lanyards allow you to give out unique lanyards to specific year groups

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Copy the example provided">
            To create a new group lanyard, copy the following

            ```python
            ["Group Name"] = {
            	Enabled = false,
            	CardColourTheme = Color3.fromRGB(34, 67, 35),
            	LanyardTitleColour = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255),
            	TextureType = "Student" 
            },
            ```
          </Step>
          <Step title="Paste it underneath the already existing custom lanyard">
            ```python
            ["CustomLanyards"] = {
            	Enabled = false,
            		
            	GroupLanyards = {
            		["Sixth Form"] = {
            			Enabled = false,
            			CardColourTheme = Color3.fromRGB(34, 67, 35),
            			LanyardTitleColour = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255),
            			TextureType = "Student" 
            		},
            		["Group Name"] = {
            			Enabled = false,
            			CardColourTheme = Color3.fromRGB(34, 67, 35),
            			LanyardTitleColour = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255),
            			TextureType = "Student" 
            		},
            	},
            },
            ```
          </Step>
          <Step title="All done! You can now configure it">
            You have successfully added your own custom lanyard. Ensure to set `Enabled = true` for it to take effect

            - `TextureType` is a configurable setting so the lanyard shows various different textures depending on the group type for example.
            - Set the TextureType to one of the following: \*\*Senior Leader, Student, Staff or Custom. \*\*For example `TextureType = "Senior Leader"`, or `TextureType = "Custom"`
            - You must set your group name correctly. Replace `["Group Name"]` with the name of the **year group** that you want to issue this lanyard to. You can find <u>group settings</u> later on in the configuration.
            - For example, if my **Group Name** was **Year 7**, I would set it to `["Year 7"]`
