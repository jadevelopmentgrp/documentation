  <Accordion title="Webhook integration" icon="webhook">
    A webhook is a **discord integration** that allows you to send authorised messages to a discord channel from an external application, in this case, **Vision MIS.**

    <Tip>
      Learn more about [discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks), and how to set them up
    </Tip>
    ```python

    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="In-game commands" icon="message">
    In-game commands are a recently added feature, allowing you to quickly perform actions without directly interacting with the Vision MIS dashboard.

    ```javascript
    ["Commands"] = {
    	-- Chat-based Vision control commands
    	Enabled = true, -- Enable/disable commands
    	Prefix = "%", -- Command prefix
    	
    	["CommandNames"] = {
    		Isolate = "isolate", 
    		Positive = "merit", 
    		Negative = "demerit", 
    		Relocate = "relocate", 
    		NonUniform = "nonuniform", 
    		Timeout = "timeout", 
    	}
    },
    ```

    The code snippet above contains **key attributes** that determine the functionality of the  commands

    - To **disable commands**, replace `Enabled = true` with `Enabled = false`
    - To **change the prefix** for commands, replace `Prefix = "%"` with your own prefix, for example `Prefix = ":"`
    - To change a command name, look for the command you want to change under `["CommandNames"]` and replace the command name in the " " with your new command name.
      - For example, replace `Positive = "merit"` with `Positive = "positive"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="On call alerts" icon="diamond-exclamation">
    On call alerts allow specific users with specific roles to receive alerts when a request is made from a member of staff. The configuration for this is very simple

    ```javascript
    ["OnCallsEnabled"] = true,
    ["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}, -- Choose every rank ID, separated by a comma which are able to manage on call alerts
    ```

    Within `["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}`, **you can add or remove role IDs**. These IDs are gathered from your Roblox group.

    To add a new role to the list, just add the number of the role ID in the `{}` . For example, if I added 255, it would now look like `{1, 2, 3, 255}`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nametags" icon="tags">
    A series of <u>attributes</u> for nametags can be toggled to adjust to your needs

    ```javascript
    ["NametagsEnabled"] = true, -- Toggle nametags being visible
    ["Staff Icon"] = true, -- Toggles staff icon above staff nametag
    ["Admin Icon"] = true, -- Toggles admin icon above admin nametag
    ```

    - **To disable one of the above**, just change `true` to `false`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gamepasses and lanyards" icon="passport">
    You are **_no longer required to use gamepass IDs_** to give out non-uniform or timeout passes. To disable the gamepass feature, just set the `GamepassID` to `0` . Otherwise, replace 0 with your gamepass ID if you wish to use this feature.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Non Uniform">
        ```javascript
        ["NonUniformPass"] = { 
        	Enabled = false,

        	LogoID = 0
        },
        ```

        When lanyards are set to `Enabled = true`, staff will receive lanyards automatically. Please set this to false if you wish for staff \*\*not \*\*to have built in Vision lanyards.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Lanyards">
        ```python

        			TextureType = "Student" 
        		},
        	},
        },

        Custom Lanyards allow you to give out unique lanyards to specific year groups

          <Step title="Copy the example provided">

          <Step title="All done! You can now configure it">
            You have successfully added your own custom lanyard. Ensure to set `Enabled = true` for it to take effect

            - `TextureType` is a configurable setting so the lanyard shows various different textures depending on the group type for example.
            - Set the TextureType to one of the following: **Senior Leader, Student, Staff or Custom.** For example `TextureType = "Senior Leader"`, or `TextureType = "Custom"`
            - You must set your group name correctly. Replace `["Group Name"]` with the name of the **year group** that you want to issue this lanyard to. You can find <u>group settings</u> later on in the configuration.
            - For example, if my **Group Name** was **Year 7**, I would set it to `["Year 7"]`
            - Add each of the **Roblox group role IDs** into the `RoleIds = {}` separated by a comma. Each of these roles will be given the lanyard

    1. To **enable or disable relocation**, change `true` to `false` or vice versa
    2. The `TeleportToFolder` is the **name** of the folder **which contains the parts where students will be teleported to**. By default this is "_Relocation_", however you can copy paste the Relocation folder under the jaVision folder in Workspace and rename it to whatever you want.
    3. An example of the above:![image.png](/image.png)
