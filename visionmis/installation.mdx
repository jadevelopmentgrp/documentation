# Studio Setup

The following instructions are to be used for installing **Vision MIS** into your game through Roblox Studio. Please head to [link here] for setting up discord integration.

<Icon icon="money-bill-wave" />  **Ensure you have the licence for this product, through** [our website](https://jadevelopment.co.uk/products/jadevelopment-vision) or our [product hub](https://www.roblox.com/games/9435095450/Product-Hub)

## Getting started

<Note>
  You must enable **HTTP Requests** and **API Services** within the Game Settings tab in Roblox studio. This is located under the Security section. Please ensure this is enabled before opening a ticket with our support team.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Place the file in Workspace">
    After downloading the product file, drag and drop into Workspace under your game
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure HTTP requests/API services are enabled">
    Check to make sure your security settings are correct. You can do this by heading to **Home** in Roblox Studio, then **Game Settings**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Under the **jaVision** folder provided, there will be a <u>Settings</u> script. Please open it to continue.

  <Accordion title="Configure Group" icon="user-group">
    An example for configuring your group is below

  <Accordion title="Webhook integration" icon="webhook">
    A webhook is a **discord integration** that allows you to send authorised messages to a discord channel from an external application, in this case, **Vision MIS.**

    <Tip>
      Learn more about [discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks), and how to set them up
    </Tip>
    ```python
    ["VisionWebhookURL"] = "",
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="In-game commands" icon="message">
    In-game commands are a recently added feature, allowing you to quickly perform actions without directly interacting with the Vision MIS dashboard.

    ```javascript
    ["Commands"] = {
    	-- Chat-based Vision control commands
    	Enabled = true, -- Enable/disable commands
    	Prefix = "%", -- Command prefix
    	
    	["CommandNames"] = {
    		Isolate = "isolate", 
    		Positive = "merit", 
    		Negative = "demerit", 
    		Relocate = "relocate", 
    		NonUniform = "nonuniform", 
    		Timeout = "timeout", 
    	}
    },
    ```

    The code snippet above contains **key attributes** that determine the functionality of the  commands

    - To **disable commands**, replace `Enabled = true` with `Enabled = false`
    - To **change the prefix** for commands, replace `Prefix = "%"` with your own prefix, for example `Prefix = ":"`
    - To change a command name, look for the command you want to change under `["CommandNames"]` and replace the command name in the " " with your new command name.
      - For example, replace `Positive = "merit"` with `Positive = "positive"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="On call alerts" icon="diamond-exclamation">
    On call alerts allow specific users with specific roles to receive alerts when a request is made from a member of staff. The configuration for this is very simple

    ```javascript
    ["OnCallsEnabled"] = true,
    ["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}, -- Choose every rank ID, separated by a comma which are able to manage on call alerts
    ```

    Within `["RankIDs"] = {1, 2, 3}`, **you can add or remove role IDs**. These IDs are gathered from your Roblox group.

    To add a new role to the list, just add the number of the role ID in the `{}` . For example, if I added 255, it would now look like `{1, 2, 3, 255}`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nametags" icon="tags">
    A series of <u>attributes</u> for nametags can be toggled to adjust to your needs

    ```javascript
    ["NametagsEnabled"] = true, -- Toggle nametags being visible
    ["Staff Icon"] = true, -- Toggles staff icon above staff nametag
    ["Admin Icon"] = true, -- Toggles admin icon above admin nametag
    ```

    - **To disable one of the above**, just change `true` to `false`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gamepasses and lanyards" icon="passport">
    You are **_no longer required to use gamepass IDs_** to give out non-uniform or timeout passes. To disable the gamepass feature, just set the `GamepassID` to `0` . Otherwise, replace 0 with your gamepass ID if you wish to use this feature.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Non Uniform">
        ```javascript
        ["NonUniformPass"] = {

      <Tab title="Lanyards">
        ```python
        ["Lanyards"] = {
        	Enabled = true, 
        	ColorTheme = Color3.fromRGB(255, 146, 32),
        	LogoID = 0

        	LogoID = 0 
        },
        ```

        When lanyards are set to `Enabled = true`, staff will receive lanyards automatically. Please set this to `false` if you wish or staff **not** to have built in Vision lanyards.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Lanyards">
        ```python
        ["CustomLanyards"] = {

        			TextureType = "Student" 
        		},
        	},
        },

            You have successfully added your own custom lanyard. Ensure to set `Enabled = true` for it to take effect

            - `TextureType` is a configurable setting so the lanyard shows various different textures depending on the group type for example.
            - Set the TextureType to one of the following: **Senior Leader, Student, Staff or Custom.** For example `TextureType = "Senior Leader"`, or `TextureType = "Custom"`
            - You must set your group name correctly. Replace `["Group Name"]` with the name of the **year group** that you want to issue this lanyard to. You can find <u>group settings</u> later on in the configuration.
            - For example, if my **Group Name** was **Year 7**, I would set it to `["Year 7"]`
            - Add each of the **Roblox group role IDs** into the `RoleIds = {}` separated by a comma. Each of these roles will be given the lanyard

### System Permissions

Ensure that you setup the correct permissions before attempting to run any commands. By default, some commands are locked to "Staff" ranks and some to "Admin" ranks, much like the in-game Vision system. Currently, you are **unable** to specify which commands you want to lock to administrator or staff members.

**Our current command permissions are below:**

| **Staff & Admin Commands** | **Admin Commands**                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| analytics                  | attendance                                      |

| timetable                  | uniform-pass **grant**  uniform-pass **remove** |
| search                     |                                                 |
| roleplay-name              |                                                 |
| timeout-pass **has**       |                                                 |
| uniform-pass **has**       |                                                 |
| merit                      |                                                 |
| behaviour-point            |                                                 |
| incident                   |                                                 |
| isolate                    |                                                 |
| detention                  |                                                 |

<Info>
  Guild Members who have any administrative roles can access both admin and staff locked commands. Guild Members who have any staff roles can only access staff locked commands.
