<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Group">
    ```lua
    GroupId = 0, --<< A Roblox group id 
    RoleIds = {1, 255}, --<< Every role id that will have permission to edit the message and modify settings 
    ```

    **RoleIds** will contain a list of Group Role IDs that will be allowed to interact with the system as a whole, including editing of messages and in-game settings

    For example, `RoleIds = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 255}`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Message">
    ```lua
    DefaultMessage = "Replace this with a message", --<< Server startup message 
    ```

    Any message inside of the `""` will appear as the default message when the server starts up
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Commands">
    ```lua
    CommandPrefix = "!", --<< Command prefix (can be anything) 
    SetCommand = "setmessage", --<< Command to set the message 
    NotifyCommand = "notify", --<< Command to notify all users
    ClearCommand = "clearmessage", --<< Command to clear the message
    ```

    The **CommandPrefix** is what declares a command that will be sent in chat. For example, I would say "`!setmessage TEXT HERE`" in chat, followed by the text

    You can edit the **SetCommand**, **NotifyCommand**, and **ClearCommand** to anything you want

    For example, I can change the **SetCommand** from `"setmessage"` to `"set"`

    ```lua
    SetCommand = "set", --<< Command to set the message 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Filtering">
    ```lua
    FilterEnabled = true, --<< Enable or disable message filtering (we are not responsible if your game is moderated) 
    HarshFilter = false, --<< When set to true, numbers and combinations of letters could be flagged by Roblox automatically ->>
    ```

    - When **FilterEnabled** is set to `true`, the Roblox chat filter will automatically apply for any messages that appear.
    - When **FilterEnabled** is set to `false`, it could put your Roblox game at risk of being moderated, however it could be unlikely unless reported or flagged

    <Warning>
      We are **<u>not</u>** responsible if your game is taken down for not having the filter enabled
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Misc">
    ```lua
    Cooldown = 3, --<< Cooldown between setting messages again (affects the entire server) 
    ```

    - You can change the cooldown to any amount of seconds (including `0`)
    - When a message is sent, the cooldown will be active until that number of seconds runs out, which prevents all other administrators from submitting updates to the banner
    - You can set the cooldown to `0` if you wish for there to be no delay between updating messages

      ```lua
      Cooldown = 0, --<< Cooldown between setting messages again (affects the entire ser
      ```

    ```lua
    ServerTimezone = "BST", --<< Server wide timezone (check the list of available timezones at the bottom) 
    MultipleServers = true, --<< Enable or disable the ability to have messages be communicated across servers 
    
    WebhookUrl = "", --<< Discord webhook URL (leave blank if not in use)
    ```

    When **MultipleServers** is set to `true`, the system will automatically send any messages or updates to settings across all servers in your game

    **WebhookUrl** is a discord webhook URL from a channel

    **ServerTimezone** is similar to Vision, where you can enter a specific timezone.

    These timezones will be available at the <u>bottom</u> of the configuration, and also found here:

      <Info>
        This must be a <u>RGB</u> colour, as shown below. You can edit this using **Roblox's built in colour picker**

    - **DefaultVisibility**

      When set to `true`, the banner will automatically be visible when the server starts up

      ```lua
      DefaultVisibility = true, 	
      ```

      When set to `false`, you will **not** be able to view the message banner, but you can still **click** in the area where the banner is. You will <u>still</u> be able to interact with the banner as usual

      ```lua
      DefaultVisibility = false, 	
      ```
    - **BorderEnabled**

      When set to `true`, it will enable all borders around visual elements\
      When set to `false`, it will disable all borers around visual elements

        Transparency = 0.5,
        ```
      </Info>
    - **GhostMode**

      When set to `true`, the entire banner will be invisible, **except** the message text

      <Info>
        The message banner will just have the text with **no** background
      </Info>
      When set to `false`, the banner will be reset to its original state, which depends on other configuration options
    - **UIPosition**

      When set to `1`, it will be right at the top of the screen, as demonstrated below

      ![Dfgkreertretrotero Pn](/images/dfgkreertretrotero.png)

        You can find the sound effect here: [Promptly Sound Effect](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/96867813755421/Promptly-SFX)

    VisionPeriods = false, --<< When set to true, the system will automatically detect when Vision periods take place, and will update the banner
    VisibleOnEvent = true, --<< When set to true, the banner will be visible when a Vision period or scheduled message happens
    ```

    **VisionPeriods**\
    When set to `true`, the system will detect when lessons occur on [Vision MIS](https://jadevelopment.co.uk/products/jadevelopment-vision), and will update the banner in time for the lesson's start time\
    \
    **VisibleOnEvent**\
    When set to `true`, the banner will be visible when a Vision period or scheduled message happens. For context, if the banner is not visible, it will make itself visible when a scheduled event occurs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scheduled Messages">
    By default, scheduled messages are **<u>not</u>** enabled

    - You can have **multiple messages** that automatically send to everyone on the banner and will notify them at the time
    - The messages will send at the specified time of the timezone that has been selected prior

    ```lua
    ScheduledMessages = {
    	Enabled = false, 
    	Messages = {
    		{
    			Title = "Welcome to the game",
    			Time = "12:00",
    			Message = "Message here",
    		},
    	}
    }
    ```

    **To make a new message, simply copy the message template below:**

    ```lua
    {
    	Title = "Hello",
    	Time = "13:00",
    	Message = "Message here",
    },
    ```

    **Then, simply paste it underneath the previous message:**

    ```lua
    ScheduledMessages = {
    	Enabled = false, 
    	Messages = {
    		{
    			Title = "Welcome to the game",
    			Time = "12:00",
