## Discord Configuration

Work in Progress

<Danger>
  We are sorry but due to the **Version 2.1.1 LuaSIMS BotTS Rewrite**, the bot configuration section for permissions is not able to be viewed via the main support documentation yet. Please create a discord ticket and request for LuaSIMS support on how to setup your permissions (as this is required to make LuaSIMS work) 

  This will be available soon.
