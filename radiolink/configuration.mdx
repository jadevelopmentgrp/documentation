## Master Config

The MasterConfig is where the majority of Radiolink configuration takes place. You will be able to manage **general settings**, **channels**, **battery**, **alerts**, **group information** and **interface settings**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Group Info">
    **Enter a community name of your choice** (this can be anything), as well as your **Community ID** for group roles to show under users on the radio

    ```luau
    ["Community Name"] = "jaDevelopment", --Set to your Community's name
    
    ["Roles"] = { --How the system determines the users role
        ["Enabled"] = true,
        ["Community"] = 14665139 -- (Community ID)
    },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Channels">
    ### Messaging

    You are able to add a delay for \*\*roleplay purposes \*\*on how long it takes for messages to be recieved by other users to add a sense of realism to radio communications. Additionally, you can skip configuration of channel permissions by enabling global channels which **gives users access to all channels**.

    <Warning>
      Your game is \*\*likely to be taken down \*\*if you disable the message filtering option as it violates Roblox ToS and jaDevelopment is not responsible if this happens.
    </Warning>
    ```luau
    ["Message Delay"] = 0.3, --Amount of seconds before a message is recieved after being sent
    ["Global Channels"] = false, --Gives every radio access to all channels no matter dock config
    ["Messages Filtering"] = true, --Uses roblox filtering with messages (we take no responsiblity if your game gets taken down)
    ```

    ### Channels

    **You can have as many channels as you wish**, an example of this section is shown below

    ```luau
    ["Channels"] = {
    	--[[
    		-Add as many channels as you would like
    		- The names in this config are not shown on the radio ui which is configured in the dock settings
    		- Channels cannot have the same names
    		- Channels cannot have the same ids
    	]]
    	["General"] = {
    		["ChannelId"] = 1 --The id for this channel (similar to radio frequency)
    	},
    	["Off Topic"] = {
    		["ChannelId"] = 2
    	},
    },
    ```

    **To create a new channel**, copy the following and insert it under the previous channel in the configuration:

    ```luau
    ["Staff"] = { -- Name of the channel
    	["ChannelId"] = 3 -- Different channel ID
    },
    ```

    **As I have now created my new channel**, it should look like this:

    ```luau
    ["Channels"] = {
    
    	--[[
    		-Add as many channels as you would like
    		- The names in this config are not shown on the radio ui which is configured in the dock settings
    		- Channels cannot have the same names
    		- Channels cannot have the same ids
    	]]
    	["General"] = {
    		["ChannelId"] = 1 --The id for this channel (similar to radio frequency)
    	},
    	["Off Topic"] = {
    		["ChannelId"] = 2
    	},
    	["Staff"] = {
    		["ChannelId"] = 3
    	},
    },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Voice Chat">
    Voice chat allows users to communicate over voice to other users who are using radios, however **voice chat must be enabled in the game settings** as well as the **server limit being at maximum 50 players**. Channel permissions for voice chat can be configured further in the dock config.

    <Info>
      A more detailed guide on setting up voice chat can be [**found here**](/radiolink/installation) in the **Voice Chat Setup** section
    </Info>
    <Warning>
      If the SelectedOnly setting is disabled and two users are in seperate channels simultaneously speaking, users that are in both channels will hear people speaking over each other
    </Warning>
    ```luau
    ["Voice Chat"] = {
    	["Enabled"] = false, --Is voice chat enabled
    	["VisiblityReq"] = false, --Are only users with voice chat able to see that someone is broadcasting voice
    	["SelectedOnly"] = true --Can you only hear voice chat on the currently selected channel (may cause overlapping if enabled)
    },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Battery">
    Battery makes the radio able to operate. There are **multiple settings** for this, including how long it takes the Radio’s battery to deplete by one percent and how fast it charges as well. You can also set the default amounts for this.

    <Info>
      Radios in the dock that are **not** at 100% are shown with a yellow LED to show they are still charging.
    </Info>
    If a radio <u>runs out of battery</u> you will be **unable to send or receive messages**.

    ```luau
    ["Battery"] = {
        ["Enabled"] = true, --Will the battery charge change
        ["Charge"] = 100, --The starting charge for the battery (from 0 - 100)
        ["Drain"] = 3, --How many minutes until 1 percent is drained
        ["Recharge"] = 1, --How many minutes until 1 percent is charged
    },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Alerts">
    Alerts can be customised to be named differently with **different use cases** they could be used to alert staff of medical emergencies, require security or on call alerts.

    ```luau
    ["Alerts"] = { --Allows staff members to submit alerts across the system
    	["Enabled"] = true,
    	["Name"] = "Emergency Alert"
    	--More settings for alerts are configured in the individual dock settings
    },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Radio Interface">
    At the bottom of the **MasterConfig,** there are <u>UI settings</u> where you can **disable statuses**, **notifications** or the **ability to pin the UI.** As well as this you can customise the UI colours with the provided options.

    ```luau
    ["Notification Sounds"] = true, --Allows notification sounds to be on or off
    ["Pin UI"] = true, --Allows the ui to be pinned
    ["Statuses"] = true, --Options to change status such as busy, available etc
    ["Primary Colour"] = Color3.fromRGB(26, 25, 23), --Change this to any colour
    ["Secondary Colour"] = Color3.fromRGB(35, 35, 35), --Change this to any colour (a slightly darker tone of the Primary colour is ideal)
    ["Message Colour"] = Color3.fromRGB(35, 35, 35) --Sets the background colour of the radio message
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Integrations">
    We currently only offer **two system integrations** which are both sold by jaDevelopment or its subsidaries. For all integrations to correctly work please ensure the products are **correctly installed** and **running the latest software version**.

    To disable any integration set the value to **nil** or otherwise the **supported system names**.

    ```
    ["Integrations"] = {
    	["School MIS"] = nil, --Supported MIS Systems are "Vision" or "LuaSIMS" (both under jaDevelopment)
    },
    ```

    <Note>
      We would **love to hear suggestions** on what systems to integrate RadioLink with in the future
    </Note>

## Dock Config

Each dock featured in the Radiolink folder has a **configuration** called '<u>DockConfig</u>', and is currently set to preset configuration settings. **Customise these options** with the following information that might help you

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Whitelist" icon="check">
    The whitelist can be **toggled on (true) or off**  **(false)**, and supports individual players or groups. You can have an unlimited amount of players and groups. Players can be listed with a mixture of user ids and usernames.

    <Warning>
      When the whitelist value is set to **false**, anyone can use the radio dock. If you are restricting the radios to groups, or users, please enable this feature by setting it to **true**
    </Warning>
    **When configuring groups, enter as many role IDs** in the `{}` as you wish, separated by a comma

    ```luau
    [14665139] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 255},
    ```

    ```luau
    ["Permissions"] = {
    	["Whitelist"] = false, 
    	
    	["Users"] = { --Supports usernames and user ids
    		936285498, --osctrcx
    		295531036, --AIIAIDAIIIAIAIAIAIIA
    		37110638, --rfpb
    		163323741, --comtrlo
    	},
    
    	["Communities"] = { --Add as many communities as you would like and role ids
    		[14665139] = {255, 254},
    	}
    },
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pickup Interaction" icon="hand-dots">
    ```luau
    ["Pickup"] = {
        ["Type"] = "ClickDetector", --ClickDetector or ProximityPrompt
        ["MaxDistance"] = 10 --How many studs away to pickup a radio
    }, 
    ```

    ### **ClickDetector**

    ![Click Detector](/images/rejkejrey.png)

    ### **ProximityPrompt**

    ![Proximity Prompt](/images/oi[i[o.avif)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dock Channels & Permissions" icon="clipboard-check">
    You can specify **what permissions the docks** from that radio has in **each of those channels.** If the dock doesn't have access to that channel you don’t need to list it at all.

    ### Permission Types

    - **TextRecieve** - View messages sent by users in that channel
    - \*\*TextSend \*\*- Send messages sent to other users in that channel
    - \*\*VoiceRecieve \*\*- Hear voice chat conversations happening in that channel
    - \*\*VoiceBroadcast \*\*- Participate in voice chat conversations in that channel

    _The name of the channel does not need to be the name you set for it in the master config._

    ### Channel Configuration

    ```luau
    ["Channels"] = { --This setting does not apply if global channels are enabled
    	--[[
    		-Don't include channels that you would like hidden for radios in this dock
    		-Add as many channels as you would like
    		-Set the following permission levels for channels:
    			1. TextRecieve
    			2. TextSend
    			3. VoiceRecieve
    			4. VoiceBroadcast
    	]]
    	["General"] = {
    		["Permissions"] = {"TextSend", "TextRecieve", "VoiceBroadcast", "VoiceRecieve"},
    		["ChannelId"] = 1 --The id you set your channel to in the main config
    	},
    	["Off Topic"] = {
    		["Permissions"] = {"TextSend", "TextRecieve", "VoiceBroadcast", "VoiceRecieve"},
    		["ChannelId"] = 2
    	},
    },
    ```

    <Info>
      Don't include any channels that you would like **hidden** for radios in this dock
    </Info>
    To create a new channel **for this dock**, <u>copy the following code</u> or one of the channels from the Channels section:

    ```luau
    ["Staff"] = { -- Channel name
        ["Permissions"] = {"TextSend", "TextRecieve", "VoiceBroadcast", "VoiceRecieve"},
        ["ChannelId"] = 3 -- Channel id
    },
    ```

    **With my new piece of code**, I can add it to the already existing list of channels, so it becomes

    ```luau
    ["Channels"] = { --This setting does not apply if global channels are enabled
    	--[[
    		-Don't include channels that you would like hidden for radios in this dock
    		-Add as many channels as you would like
    		-Set the following permission levels for channels:
    			1. TextRecieve
    			2. TextSend
    			3. VoiceRecieve
    			4. VoiceBroadcast
    	]]
    	["General"] = {
    		["Permissions"] = {"TextSend", "TextRecieve", "VoiceBroadcast", "VoiceRecieve"},
    		["ChannelId"] = 1 --The id you set your channel to in the main config
    	},
    	["Off Topic"] = {
    		["Permissions"] = {"TextSend", "TextRecieve", "VoiceBroadcast", "VoiceRecieve"},
    		["ChannelId"] = 2
    	},
    	["Staff"] = { -- Channel name
       		["Permissions"] = {"TextSend", "TextRecieve", "VoiceBroadcast", "VoiceRecieve"}, -- Permissions the channel WILL have
        		["ChannelId"] = 3 -- Channel id
    	},
    },
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Alerts" icon="siren-on">
    If enabled, the alerts **can be turned off only for radios in one dock** and you can also **specify which channels the alerts go to,** even if the radios in that dock do not have permission to view or send messages in the channels you set. As long as its in the master config, it will function as intended. You can also set it to false instead of a table and it sends it to all channels across the system

    ### **Default configuration for dock alerts**

    ```luau
    ["Alerts"] = {
    	["Enabled"] = true, --Can radios from this dock utilise the feature?
    	["Channels"] = {1} --Every channel ID the alerts will send to, separated by a comma
    	--[[
    	- The radio does not need any access to any of the channels
    	- Set to false to broadcast to all channels - ["ChannelId"] = false
    	]]
    },
    ```

    <Check>
      To send alerts from the dock to **all channels**, simply remove all channel IDs from within the `{}` next to "Channels"

      \
      **For example:**

      ```luau
      ["Channels"] = false
      ```
