    <Info>
      Due to Roblox limitations on sound ownership, verification and validation, all customers **will have to upload their own versions of our audio IDs**. We're very sorry for making you run through this step, however it is necessary (if you want sounds to functions)

  </Step>
  <Step title="All done!">
    You should now be able to test and make sure the Radio is working in its current state
